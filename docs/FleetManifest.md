# ⚙️ NO QUARTER ROBOTICS => FLEET MANIFEST
> *"Give No Quarter. Take No Lag."*

## 🏴‍☠️ Overview
**No Quarter Robotics** is an open-source robotics initiative dedicated to modular, 3D-printed hardware and distributed control systems.  
At the helm stands **Captain JollyRoot**, builder of bots and breaker of limits.  
Our systems run on the flagship OS **JollyOS** uniting the fleet under one code.

## 🧰 Core Principles
- **Modularity:** Every bot is a ship, every circuit a crewmate.  
- **Open Source:** Freedom through collaboration and design transparency.  
- **Resilience:** Our bots don’t crash — they mutinize and come back stronger.  
- **Style:** Because even the bravest bots deserve good names.
